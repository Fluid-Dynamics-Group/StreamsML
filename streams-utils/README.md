# User Instructions

All user actions take place in the streams-utils subdirectory of StreamsML

## Software Build Instructions

> - Setup  
>   - Check your OS' minimum CUDA driver requirements  
>   - Execute install_dependencies.sh to add required paths to your bash file, create a virtual environment, and install local software dependencies therein.  
> - Build  
>   - Sequentially run "just nv", "just base", "just build" to create the final streams.sif container in which the software will run.
##

### Setup

> **After checking the system requirements below, clone the StreamsML repository**
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/fluid-Dynamics-Group/StreamsML.git --depth 1
> ```
>
> **Then add paths to the two directories within StreamsML into your bashrc, sourcing your bashrc file afterwards to apply the changes**
>
> ```bash
> export STREAMS_DIR="/path/to/your/streams"
> export STREAMS_UTILS_DIR="/path/to/your/streams-utils"
> ```
>
> **Next, execute install_dependencies.sh to create a virtual environment and install dependencies.**
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
> bash install_dependencies.sh
> ```
>
> **Lastly, reference the online documentation to install Apptainer**
>
> ```
> https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html
> ```

**Components of modSTREAmS build:**

- NVIDIA HPC SDK: A docker image, provided by Nvidia, to contain the libraries and tools required for GPU-accelerated, portable HPC modeling and simulation applications.
- base.apptainer: An apptainer image used to install required software, such as PyTorch, h5py, and an Ubuntu OS.
- build.apptainer: An apptainer image used to compile the Fortran and Rust code, and bind the Python code to the built streams.sif container.

**System Requirements**  
In order to use Nvidia HPC SDK, version 24.7-devel-cuda_multi-ubuntu22.04, the following requirements must be met:

### Build

Now that the setup has been completed, the remaining build becomes a simple sequent of three terminal commands.

> **From the streams-utils directory, run the following commands:**
>
> ```bash
> just nv
> just base
> just build
> ```

after which the software is built and all further interaction with the software is completed by editing the parameters in the Justfile, a document found in that same streams-utils directory.

## Configuring and Running a Standard Simulation

> - Configuring and running  a standard simulation  
>   - Edit the config recipe of the justfile, selecting simulation type, control type, and all parameters related to the two.  
>   - Copy the relevant config recipe found in the **JustfileExamples** folder to efficiently collect the flags required for your simulation and control type.  
>   - Type "just help name", replacing name with the name of a recipe or flag, for the use and all possible arguments of a given flag, and similarly the flags of a particular recipe.  
>   - Run "just config" to generate the necessary files for the run using the flags from the config recipe  
> - Run  
>   - Start the simulation with "just run"

### Configuring and Running a Standard Simulation

The first decision to make is whether you would like to run a simulation of a boundary layer (BL) flow or shock-boundary layer interaction flow (SBLI).

> Uncomment the option you would like to run, around lines 36-37.
>
> ```text
> # streams_flow_type := "shock-boundary-layer"
> # streams_flow_type := "boundary-layer"
> ```

Next, the config section, the heart of the user interface where simulation and control method parameters are selected. As seen below, there are two offset columns of options. The first contains options pertaining to configuring the simulation itself, such as the mach number and grid specifications, and the second has options pertaining to the control method, which itself is specified at the interface of the two columns, here seen to be learning-based ddpg.

The first column of options are used for all simulations. As previously mentioned, the control strategy (here learning-based) and method (here ddpg) are selected at the interface of the first and second columns. There are three control strategy groups (open-loop, classical, and learning-based) and within each there are a certain number of algorithms that may be chosen. For example, learning-based has the control strategies of ddpg, ppo, and dqn available. The control method and control strategy determine the options the second column is required to contain.

> Populate the config recipe of the justfile with flags and values corresponding to the simulation you would like to run

**Please see the justfile examples folder for a comprehensive set of configuration templates.**
